Sapiens are an ancient civilization coming from the stars.
All humanoid races inhabiting the world descend from them.
Luminata is built upon their landing site and is now just an old ruin (greek-inspired).
Underneath Luminata is the wrecked ship used by the sapiens to get to the planet in the first place.
One of the sapiens is still inside the ship, alive, but artificially preserved in a cryogenic hibernation, until Iryo and Aura find him and wake him up (final quest).
When the sapiens approached the planet, some of them, afraid by the harsh conditions of the planet, did everything the could to hide from the surface and eventually evolved into Moorl.
Other sapiens desperately tried to fix the teleportation device in an attempt to get back to their home planet.
Once the teleportation device was put back together, one of the sapiens offered himself to try it. Unfortunately, the device broke down again right after dematerializing and storing him in memory.
The poor soul has been trapped inside the contraption ever since, frozen in time and space.
All the sapiens, then accepted their fate and went on with their life, coping with the native species of the planet and making it their new home.
The Moorl hold the key to unlock the machine and are not willing to give it away to strangers, because they don't want to restore it.
When Iryo and Aura get to the machine with the necessary elements to fix it, they are able to rematerialize the Sapiens hidden in it.
The Moorl are hostile to intruders and fight them (a bit like TES' Falmers).
Surface people talk about the salvation device hidden in the mountain deeps (the teleport machine).
The salvation machine is a godly device that will bring people to the original world (the Sapiens' home planet), made by God when he came to the planet.
The Sapiens are humans and the story takes place in a distant future.
