"""
Demonstrates one way of fixing the display resolution to a certain
size, but rendering to the full screen.

The method used in this example is:

1. Create a Framebuffer object, and a Texture of the desired resolution
2. Attach the Texture to the Framebuffer.
2. Bind the Framebuffer as the current render target.
3. Render the scene using any OpenGL functions (here, just a shape).
4. Unbind the Framebuffer, and blit the Texture scaled to fill the screen.
